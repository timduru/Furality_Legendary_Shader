This is a modified version of the original Furality Legendary Shader

	-Download link and online Readme of the original Shader located at: https://furality.org/legendaryshader	

The original shader was made to work and be controlled in real time by VJs during Furality's events.
Outside of furality's worlds there were no automated effects, debug mode provided a few effects but the speed was not configurable. 

This modified version of the shader aims to enhance that by adding  AudioLink Support, as well as adding a few extra controls / fallbacks through enhancing the Debug / Simulation mode

# Additions
 ## AudioLink Support
Basic Support Added: 
- Luma Low Band  => AudioLink Bass band
- Luma High Band => AudioLink HighMids band


Can be combined with:
- Luma Zones effects
- Simulation mode effects as fallback
(if the glow mode of one channel is not configured to use audio reactivity, it will then use the corresponding channel effect as configured in the simulation mode)


 ## Simulation mode

- Speed control of the 4 different emissions in Simulation mode
- Basic audio patterns variations
- allow to temporarily disable Main Emission control by the world or debug mode (restores it to full emission)

All these can be animated/changed in real time for more versatility so you can change them based on the music or current mood.

# Original shader features

	-This shader stylizes lighting effects to match Furality's worlds artstyle-
	
		The Furality Legendary Shader allows you to pick between a selection of stylized lighting
		effects.  These effects are designed to help you match your avatar to our world's artstyle.
		The shader was also designed to be highly customizable with a large selection of combinations
		to create your own unique effects.

	-Luma Glow V2!-
		
		Luma Glow has been expanded and improved to include additional effects and control.
		You can now manually pick between glow zones on your material and there are now
		zones dedicated to gradients!  Another new feature is audio reactivity.  This
		will cause your emissions to blink or pulse with the beat of the music as well as
		be controlled by our colors.

	-What is Luma Glow?-

		While you are inside our supported Furality Legends worlds, your avatar's emissions will
		recieve special effects.  While inside our club, your emissions will pulse, change color,
		and flash with the beat of the music!  Outside of the club, our other worlds will have
		additional effects!

	-Optimized world-to-avatar control-

		This shader was designed to read data directly from our own sources.  This means you
		don't have to do any audio processing on your end!  Other effects are processed on 
		your GPU, saving you that precious CPU performance.

	-Faked Realtime Global Illumination-

		Because of CPU limitations we cannot use realtime lightmaps on our club world to show off
		all the amazing lighting effects. To get around this, we created a fake GI shader for the
		world that is fed the light data from our sources, bypassing your need to calculate it!
		The shader then picks this up using a realtime reflection probe that is then sampled by this
		shader in a special way that allows it to emulate the same GI but on your avatar!

	-How will the worlds affect my emission colors?-

		Our worlds will tint your emission color by another color they send.
		If you want to recieve our world colors exactly without tinting, use a white and black emission.

## How to apply
		
	-Avatar Application-
	
		1. Open the "Legendary Shader Example Scene" to view examples of the shader pre-applied
		2. Import your avatar into the scene
		3. Duplicate one of the example materials ( CTRL + D )
		4. Drag it onto your avatar
		5. Apply your textures and adjust material settings as needed

## Shader Properties

	-New custom GUI for ease of use-

		The Furality Legendary Shader has its own custom inspector GUI that was designed now to
		overwhelm new users with a large list of properties all on one page.  All properties
		are sorted between their respective pages and an "advanced toggle" is included for those
		who wish for expanded features.
